<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>IMPORTANT</b></span>: Your use of the Bell Connected Car application (the “<b>App</b>”) with associated services provided and powered by Mojio Inc., is governed by the Mojio Terms of Use and Privacy Policy found at moj.io. You should not download, install or use the App if you do not understand or agree to the Mojio Terms of Use and/or Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="p4">These Bell Connected Car Terms of Service apply solely to your use of the ZTE Z6200C device which connects to your vehicle’s on-board diagnostics (OBD-II) port (the “<b>ZTE OBD-II Device</b>”) and the wireless telecommunications services provided to you by Bell Mobility Inc. (“<b>Bell</b>” or “<b>Bell Mobility</b>”) in connection with Bell Connected Car. In addition, you remain subject to Bell Mobility’s Terms of Service and the Responsible Use of Bell Services Policy governing your use of the Bell services, all of the terms of which are incorporated by reference herein (visit bell.ca/legal). Bell may modify these Bell Connected Car Terms from time to time, including by modifying or terminating Bell Connected Car, or any components thereof (including which rate plans and/or data features are eligible for use with Bell Connected Car).</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Always employ safe driving practices. You are responsible for obeying all traffic laws and laws directed at distracted driving (including use of mobile devices while driving). Bell Mobility reminds you that it is unsafe and illegal to drive while using your mobile device unless you are using handsfree capabilities</b></span><b>.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b></b><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li7"><b>How does the Bell Connected Car service</b><span class="s2"><b> </b></span><b>work?</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="p8"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p9">When loaded on a compatible mobile device, the App provided by Mojio works with the ZTE OBD-II Device and Bell’s wireless services to provide certain tools and services such as an in-car Wi-Fi hotspot, select telemetry information and basic vehicle diagnostics.</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li11"><b>What are some of my responsibilities relating to the ZTE OBD-II</b><span class="s3"><b> </b></span><b>Device?</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="p8"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p12">Among other responsibilities, you agree and acknowledge:</p>
<p class="p13"><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li11">you will install the ZTE OBD-II Device in a compatible vehicle owned and controlled by you; to determine if your vehicle is compatible, please visit<span class="s4"> </span>bell.ca/checkmycar;</li>
    <li class="li14">you will not install or remove the ZTE OBD-II Device while your vehicle is in<span class="s4"> </span>use;</li>
    <li class="li15">you will ensure the ZTE OBD-II Device is installed securely and properly in your vehicle’s OBD-II port;<span class="s5"> </span>and</li>
    <li class="li16">the ZTE OBD-II Device goes into sleep mode when your vehicle is not in use, to conserve battery drain. It is recommended you unplug the ZTE OBD-II Device if you plan to park your vehicle for several weeks at a<span class="s6"> </span>time to help avoid battery<span class="s7"> </span>drain.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<p class="p17"><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li11"><b>Does the ZTE OBD-II Device use my wireless data</b><span class="s8"><b> </b></span><b>services?</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p9">Yes, on an ongoing basis, the ZTE OBD-II Device will send your vehicle information to Mojio for the telematics portion of the App. This activity uses your wireless data services. This data usage will continue, even if you have turned off your Bell Connected Car Wi-Fi hotspot or if your vehicle’s engine is turned off. Also, when you use the Bell Connected Car Wi-Fi hotspot, plan data usage will be incurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>The only way to stop the ZTE OBD-II Device from using any of your wireless data services is to unplug it from the OBD-II port, which should only be done while your vehicle is not in use.</b></p>
<p class="p18"><b></b><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li11"><b>Does Bell Connected Car work outside of</b><span class="s8"><b> </b></span><b>Canada?</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="p8"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p9">Yes, Bell Connected Car will work in the United States.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Roaming and data charges apply.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li11"><b>How many digital devices can connect to the Bell Connected Car Wi-Fi</b><span class="s3"><b> </b></span><b>Hotspot?</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="p19"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p9">You can connect up to <b>5 </b>Wi-Fi capable digital devices (such as smartphones, tablets and laptops) to the Bell Connected Car Wi-Fi hotspot. The Bell Connected Car Wi-Fi hotspot is password-protected, so it is only available to those who have the password.</p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li20"><b>How does Bell limit its liability in respect of Bell Connected</b><span class="s8"><b> </b></span><b>Car?</b></li>
</ol>
<p class="p21">The Bell Mobility Terms of Service, including the warranties and limitation of liability therein, apply to your use of the ZTE OBD-II Device and the wireless telecommunications services provided to you in connection with Bell Connected Car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a reminder, the Mojio Terms of Service at moj.io are applicable to, and govern your use of, the App.</p>
<p class="p22"><br></p>
<p class="p23">In addition, Bell does not warrant that your use of Bell Connected Car will result in any savings or efficiencies in the operation of your vehicle, or that the App’s detection of driving activity, mechanical errors or technical errors in your vehicle will be accurate. You acknowledge and agree that Bell Connected Car is not intended to replace the advice of licensed mechanics or proper vehicle maintenance, which you remain responsible for obtaining.</p>
<p class="p24">You also acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for your use of the ZTE OBD-II Device, the App and/or the wireless services and any accident, damage, liability, bodily injury or death that might occur to you, your property, third parties or their property resulting from said use, even if the ZTE OBD-II Device, App or wireless services contribute to the cause of the accident, damages, liability, bodily injury or death.</p>
